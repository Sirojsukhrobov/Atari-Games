# Welcome to Atari Games
***

## Task
Your Mission
Your mission is to build an AI that "plays" Atari video games. You will build 3 diffeent models that solve three different Atari games.

You will use the help of neural networks to solve problems using reinforcement learning and the Deep Q-Network (which represents the optimal action-value function as a neural network instead of a table).

Atari games have a large variety of screens, among other things, rendering it unsolvable using a Q-table. Learners must create an algorithm that "plays" Atari video games better than humans (and using all 49 Atari games to train the model is recommended!!). GPUs are becoming indispensable for learning problems that involve large neural networks. We will be using GPUs for training networks on larger-scale tasks.
